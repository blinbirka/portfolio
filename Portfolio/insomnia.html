                <p class="mtext">Insomnia is an international non-profit open-air animation festival. In 2023, the organizers decided to create a local portal.</p>
                <p class="mtext">The portal team consisted of a PM, Product Owner, 2 designers, 5 developers, and a tester. The project was created from scratch in 5 months.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="container-subH-text">
                <h3 class="mh3" style="color: var(--grey)">Role & project</h3>
                <p class="mtext">I joined the team as a junior designer at the beginning of 2023. I conducted research alone and, together with the senior designer, developed the architecture and created the design. I negotiated with key stakeholders and supported developers in implementation.</p>

                <h3 class="mh2">Work stages</h3>
                <p class="mtext">Initially, InSight was created to relieve the reception of the festival - the Info Center. In 2021, many people came to Insomnia, and the festival could not cope with such an influx of people. In 2022, the festival broke all its records, and 20 thousand people were on the field! All these people went to the Info Center and in the end formed queues for several hours.</p>
                <p class="mtext">Insight was supposed to unload the Info Center and provide answers to questions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="container-subH-text">
                <h3 class="mh3" style="color: var(--grey)">Research</h3>
                <p class="mtext">At the research stage, I was the only designer. I started interviewing organizers and attending large organizational meetings. There I asked what they expected from the project.</p>
                <p class="mtext">Of the difficulties: we have about 140 organizers and even more volunteers. About a third of them were interested in the portal, and everyone wanted to contribute and tell their wishes. Since I was new, I did not know who to go to with questions. In the end, I stopped at 3 organizers responsible for animation, locations, and the Info Center.</p>
                <p class="mtext">Then, based on the wishes of these organizers, I conducted a survey among festival visitors. 300 people took part in this survey! I almost sorted out all the answers, and I had an impressive list of features.</p>
                <p class="mtext">I also conducted 7 different interviews with survey participants. I tried to choose as diverse people as possible to take into account and understand people of different audiences.</p>
